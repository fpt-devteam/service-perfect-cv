## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. **Dependency Injection**

-   NotificationService được inject vào tất cả các service cần thiết
-   Sử dụng constructor injection pattern

### 2. **Error Handling**

-   Notification failures không làm crash main operation
-   Log errors nhưng không throw exceptions
-   Graceful degradation

### 3. **Device Token Management**

-   Tự động lấy device tokens của user từ database
-   Skip notification nếu user không có device tokens
-   Support multiple devices per user

### 4. **Async Operations**

-   Tất cả notification operations đều async
-   Không block main operation flow

## Testing

### 1. **Test Endpoints**

```http
GET http://localhost:8080/api/push-notifications/test-config
GET http://localhost:8080/api/push-notifications/test-token
```

### 2. **Manual Testing**

-   Update bất kỳ section nào trong CV
-   Kiểm tra notification được gửi đến device
-   Verify notification content đúng với action

### 3. **Error Scenarios**

-   Test khi không có device tokens
-   Test khi FCM service down
-   Test khi service account key invalid

## Configuration Required

### 1. **FCM Settings**

```json
{
    "FcmSettings": {
        "ServiceAccountKeyPath": "/path/to/firebase-service-account.json",
        "ProjectId": "your-firebase-project-id"
    }
}
```

### 2. **Device Token Registration**

-   User cần đăng ký device token khi login
-   Token được lưu trong DeviceTokens table
-   Support multiple platforms (Web, iOS, Android)

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Rich Notifications**

-   Thêm data payload cho deep linking
-   Custom notification sounds
-   Action buttons

### 2. **Notification Preferences**

-   User có thể tắt/bật notifications
-   Customize notification frequency
-   Filter by notification type

### 3. **Analytics**

-   Track notification delivery rates
-   Monitor user engagement
-   A/B testing notification content

### 4. **Batch Notifications**

-   Group multiple updates
-   Reduce notification spam
-   Smart notification scheduling
